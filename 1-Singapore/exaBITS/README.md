exaBITS is a decentralized computing network for affordable AI at scale. Suppose training a small (million-edge) graph on AWS, at $400/h, or $300,000/month.

exaBITS provides an economical solution by pooling computing resources from mining rigs and individual miners. Our unique technology can partition large AI models and run them on very weak GPUs.

By adopting this technology, we can reduce the computing costs by 80%. exaBITS is incubated by the Harvard Innovation Lab and is the first and only web3 project of its kind in its history.

The team members come from Harvard, Princeton, and UC Berkeley, with working experiences of The White House, Microsoft, Meta, Huawei, and the world's largest hardware-blockchain project. The testnet is live, with 2000+ nodes joined the network.

With this, we welcome you to exaBITS.
